Replace this file's contents with the corpus text you want to train on.

As a suggestion, I've found using Regular Expressions to clean text in Notepad++ works well.

You can use Regular Expressions (REGEX) in Notepad++ by bringing up the Find window, going to the Search Mode options on the bottom-left, and selecting Regular Expression.

The training system doesn't support special characters well, so it's a good idea to clean them out.

Find non-asscii characters
[^\x00-\x7F]

To take out these characters:

1. Go to the Replace tab in the Notepad++ window.
2. Enter the expression and leave the replace with section blank.
3. Go to the top of the file.
4. Click "Find" once.
5. Click Replace All.

Use these steps to clean up your corpus. Keep in mind long sentences and prose are harder to pattern match for training on basic grammar. Consider putting a gap between sentences and selecting to remote sentences over a certain length. For example, Twitter likes 140 characters, so setting Sequence to 160 give enough space that the training can pick up on ending sentences with punctuation.

There are additional Regular Expression commands that I've used below.

Find capitalized words (The 5 is how many capped letter recurrences are allowed
([A-Z][a-zA-Z0-9-]*[\w]{0,1}){5,}

Select any line with the words “Project Gutenberg” in it.
^(.*?)Project Gutenberg(.*?)$

Find incorrect capitalization
[a-z][A-Z]\s

Find all Capped letters and put a space in front of it
([A-Z])
Replace with:
 \1

Find all numbers (With match case turned off)
(?![a-z])\w+

Select anything between quotes
("([^"]|"")*")

(^|\.)[^"]*\K"(?=[^"]*(\.|$))

Select from “}” to “{footnote”
(\{footnote).+?(?=\})

Select Text in Brackets
\[(.*?)\]

Find non-asscii characters
[^\x00-\x7F]

Find every @twitter name in a document

([@])\w

Find URL

(http|ftp|https):\/\/{1}(\S*)

Find all duplicated lines

^(.*)(\r?\n\1)+$

Match any text blocks over 140 characters
.{140,}

Match all RT
RT (.*)

Match all #Harmonblock2017
(.*) #harmonblock2017
